Why you might need it
If you are an open-source application integrator as we are in open-ecommerce.org you will lot of your time instaling and configuring applications like Joomla, Magento, WP etc. over and over again for your customers.

Our aproach to reduce deploiment times is to have a repository that we call it "master" with the latest tested versions of the web applications we use configured with the most used plugins, modules and themed with our wireframe template.

We was using bash scripts to duplicate this envirouments but it was a bit a mess to change credentials and other things every time.  Also we not always have access to the ssh console and our aim was build the site in our first meeting with our customer.

This application do all that but from a web interface.
